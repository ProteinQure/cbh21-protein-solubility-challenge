 The Team  
 K. Armstrong 
- PhD student in Computer Science, Bioinformatics(M.Sc.), Biochemistry(BSc) - Machine learning, deep learning and Bioinformatics

  G. Grey 
- PhD student in Biochemistry, Biochemistry (M.Bio.), Biochemistry(BSc) - structural and functional protein biochemistry

 M. Parkin 
- Post-Apprenticeship - General Computing, Software Engineering and Networking

Aims  
1 - Learn from both sequence and structure  
2 - Ensure features are representative of all the data  
3 - Machine Learning -> predictions.py  

Machine Learning Outline
- Preprocessor -> ColumnTransformer with KBins discretiser and onehot encoding
- Selector -> Recursive Feature Elimination
- Regressor -> Random Forest Regressor
- Parameter Tuning -> GridSearchCV with a verbose of 10 and cv of 5
